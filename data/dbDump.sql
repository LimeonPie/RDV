My current CCW gun, an S&amp;W 4505, has NEVER failed, despite a lack of desire to keep the gun clean &amp; well lubricated, in at least two thousand rounds downrange. I have probably fired between 2,000-3,000 rounds through the Colt, and had four malfunctions, including one that required factory servicing. It has only one remaining saving grace: with the hammer shroud on, it can be fired through the pocket of my heavy winter coat. If not for this, I would have rid myself of this gun long ago. Revolvers are very sensitive to things like lint, sweat (even with stainless steel guns!), and dirt getting into nooks &amp; crannies and causing binding problems. Modern, high quality semiatomatics, loaded with modern, high quality ammunition, are the most reliable firearms on the market.

The crucial observation is that, by runtime, the software is already in users'' hands, and so detecting an error at runtime isn''t as helpful as detecting an error at compile time--*before* the software has reached users'' hands. That''s it. So given the option, yes, most reasonable developers use statically-typed languages for software that will be delivered to users.\r\n\r\nWhere dynamically-typed languages have primarily gained in popularity over the last several years is, of course, in the web application space, because errors tend to be more easily resolved *in situ* using dynamically-typed languages. Still, state-of-the-art statically-typed languages like Scala, used in the lift web application framework, will probably make inroads here over the next few years.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the problem remains that static typing actually *does* aid in reducing the error rates in software (yes, yes, I know... agile development... test-driven development... yada yada. Been there, done that, still have the scars, and go read Dave Pollack''s blog about migrating a Rails app to lift). People don''t tend to leave static typing because of static typing; they tend to leave it because the mainstream static type systems today aren''t sufficiently expressive and the powerful ones haven''t made much of an effort to go mainstream. Scala is a good first shot at correcting that, and whatever Tim Sweeney cooks up will likely become the second successful example, given Tim''s track record.\r\n\r\nIn any case, from the perspective of programming language design, it''s still preferable to use the typed/untyped terminology, because it accurately reflects fundamental design choices that are among the first you make when you design a language, or compare existing designs. That''s considerably more important than pandering to one language-user community or another with respect to whether they feel the properties of their language are being accurately perceived based on people''s use of the terminology.', '2008-01-15 15:15:55', 5854952);

The article supports this. \r\n\r\n&gt; it''s absurd to think there aren''t people between the incredibly poor, and the incredibly rich.\r\n\r\nThe widening wealth gap between the rich and the poor essentially shrinks the middle class - and yes, it''s happening in the US at alarming rates. \r\n\r\n&gt; So yeah, in countries without professors, lawyers, engineers, doctors, and priests...\r\n\r\nYou''d be surprised. Note that it''s not JUST the presence of doctors, lawyers and other professionals that indicates a middle class, but the presence of those professionals *hailing from lower income families*. Ask yourself: where are the growing numbers of doctors, lawyers and professionals in the US coming from, the wealthy or the poor?  \r\n\r\nCountries with growing economies typically have a large middle class, but again, USA is the exception. These days the biggest middle class populations, in terms of percentages, are found in countries like India and China. \r\n\r\nThen you have absolutely destitute countries like Somalia on one end, and supposedly "rich" countries like USA on the other, both of which have a nonexistent or shrinking middle class for very different reasons. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '2008-01-15 16:08:03', 5854952),

Just guessing here, but it is quite possible that, by disallowing certain kinds of hacks, Haskell programs become less fragile when they grow larger.  It''s true, though, that this isn''t an issue for many applications where scripting languages are used.  AFAIK, Haskell''s uses in industry are in areas where correctness is a major concern, not necessarily quick time-to-marked (though, I think it doesn''t score too bad here, either).\r\n\r\nLately, I''ve been writing a bit of code that needs quite a bit of state and it feels quite repetitive, mainly due to Haskell''s bad record support, but also because getting out of a monad can be hard.  Maybe this is one area where Haskell feels awkward to you.\r\n\r\nOne thing, though.  When using state in Haskell it is automatically thread-save (unless you use IORef), whereas in most other languages I know of the implicit state is global.  (Erlang only has explicit state for each process, and the implicit global state of all processes.  CL can have thread-local "global" vars, if you re-bind them in a thread.)  I think the great thing about Haskell, that it introduced some nice research results in a practical programming language, like STM, Data-Parallel Haskell, some type-system features.  ByteStrings were a nice practical contribution.  At the same time it is more than just a research language.  I think Scala is similar in this respect.
